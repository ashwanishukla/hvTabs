# hvTabs
Horizontal & Vertical Tabs (H-V Tabs)

This widget plugin has been developed in order to overcome the boundaries of *jTabs* with structural dependency of &lt;ul>-&lt;li>-&lt;div>-&lt;a>

Defaults though have been intialised in accordance with what people have been using in *jTabs* so that they can easily shift from *jTabs* to **hvTabs**

This plugin has been developed to help people achieve better results with minimal efforts.

This is an open-source contribution from my side to the dev community.

At this time I don't have any idea about the standards or licenses.

#Requires
This plugin requires *jquery.ui* and *jquery.widget*
